# Conversational RAG with PDF Uploads and Chat History
This project implements a Conversational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Streamlit. The application allows users to upload PDF files and interact with their content through a chat interface. The system maintains conversation history to provide context-aware responses.

Features
- PDF Uploads: Users can upload multiple PDF files.
- Chat Interface: Users can ask questions about the uploaded PDFs.
- Conversation History: The system maintains chat history to provide context-aware responses.
- Model Selection: Users can select between different language models.
- Embeddings: Uses HuggingFace embeddings for document processing.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Combines document retrieval with language model generation to answer questions.
